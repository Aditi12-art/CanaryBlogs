        And all this feeling of walking away in you is because of this world and the people who always judge you and you couldn’t breathe between them , your stomach is aching , you are running out inside.No one can see the struggle of yours to hold yourself everyday stand in front of them everyday pretending nothing is happening, everything is fine.Even if some of good ones pays attention and asked you what happened why are you remains so lost everytime? Why you suddenly becomes silent? Why you suddenly shh. yourself while talking? and you appreciate that atleast someone noticed you , all of your grief and pain flooded in your eyes and the words are almost on your tongue..  you wanted to tell ,you wanted say it but than you remember that you just can’t let them see inner you they cannot help you in this you have to fight it on your own , telling them only makes you look weaker and they will spread this thing among others which you will  hate not them(because you already do hate all) this time but yourself why you let them see inner you. And you say is “I am always sleepy , I love to sleep everytime” and everything is same as before!
        And then you think may be its good for me to go away but also you can’t just go inspite of you wanted to go because lots of questions behind you is going to be asked from your loved ones who also don’t know where you are , and may be they also start searching of you which you don’t want. 
        But I know there is the time will come when you are full upto your mouth then that one thing which is holding you to walk away also can’t stop you! And finally the state comes of 
         fading away ……………..

        Silence of a person is the most harmful and dangerous weapon from which a person is harming himself each and every day . Lots of words , lots of thoughts, lots of confusion , lots of anger, lots of disappointments , lots of frustration, and lots of confusion behind that silence . 
        Believe me its really hard to keep these in yourself and every moment you wanted to say , you wanted to get yourself empty , you wanted to feel light but the thing is you just stay quiet because you know when you let yourself to speak out whatever you are feeling is going to create a real mess , which you can’t cover up after. Because these are the real thing which you felt and you cannot change you statement. So you decided to stay shh….!! But the problem is , person in front of you neither felt their mistakes nor thinks that what they are doing , what they are saying probably can hurt someone. But no they just keep saying , keep doing same mistakes again and again and you hold yourself not to say anything because you know your words can let the person down in a second. And gradually you get used to it and you start even hiding the good things also which you wanted to tell your loved ones that you care for them , it affects you , you need them  , you wanted to be with them but you start hiding this behind your silence where  no one can listen ,and  no one ever get to know anything. 
        When it gets worse , you just cut of yourself from others not from the mean people but also from the loved ones in the fear of hurting them because the aggression is born from silence can badly hurt the good ones and you know that so you keep yourself away people you started loved to be alone.
        “Silence speaks everything” I think you all must have heard But Silence and not to say are two phase of coins. They are not same, when you don’t say it means you are not saying to the person but may be you say to others, may be you say it in the empty room and when you pushed little you are gonna say it. So its short term. But…but…but… silence is not even near it……..In this case you just keep it to yourself ,you make yourself thing with a dagger called silence. You scream without voice. Its really really hard!!! I know.. I know ……..
        By the way its never come but if it is , its going to burst out in a very bad manner like tsunami  there is no way back after that , you cannot see behind. 
              Silence before Tsunami is what you called”

        There are two types of drowning, first is when you are drowning in water and the second one is in life, and believe me… it  hits very hard, every second is felt by you and it is so painful which is 100 times gut-wrenching more than the feeling of drowning in water. In water you feel cold , and you try so hard to survive , to get rid of it , shakes you hand in water , you just wanted to live. But while drowning in life , its like your body…..sorry not body  your organs are burning, your heart is like “I don’t want to beat anymore” and this time you don’t even try to rescue yourself you never make up leeway.You just stay their and let yourself drowning and feel the pain in every cell of your body. 
        And there is no way to reduce this pain because you are surrounding by everyone you can’t shout their, you can not tell to anyone , you can not cry in front of anyone because that makes you more miserable and even no one can help out you in this.Its just you and your sunova, sertraline and sleep glummies.
        And the fact is… there are 90% chances that you can survive in water but only 10% survival in life. And in this 10% most easiest way is, which is impossible by the way when someone gives you that selfless hug for 1 min and you are out from your drowning period.Now you will try to help yourself but this phase becomes much more difficult than before because if you fall now ……there is no way back !!!
        I would say drowing in water is much easier than in life…………..

        Jumping from the 5 floors building , hang yourself , or eating poision going to solve your all the problems.

        Joy was more smarter than Raju when Joy can’t see anything happy coming he decided to say goodbye to his life which was his correct decision . On contrary when Raju was also living his life so hell but he choose struggle he struggle too hard but also a point came in his life when he thinks suicide will help he tried but due to his bad luck he is saved anyhow and again in his hell life. May be his way is wrong to suicide I think he should follow the same way as joy did.
        Ok we can talk about consequences also on Joy’s death some fake cries , some concern cries not for joy but for his happy ending in Joy’s life. And Raju is again waiting for the next trauma in his life. And making himself alive for his 80’s where he only have to lay down on the bed and watching others enjoy.Because at that time you are too weak to do something. But to end your life needs very courage and strength which everyone don’t have. Do you know when which  is the bestest way to die , first we all think that we can take a pills or we can eat salfash and it will be easy going to sleep but you are wrong when you take it is acid ofcourse and its like you are burning inside , it will take 15 minutes of time when every second you will be tormented like you have seen hell on the earth already. Every second your soul is screaming and asking you to stop this . But its all over at that time you can not save yourself even if you wanted to.

        Your family is struggling , you are struggling its like each and every member of your family is struggling. And you always thinking that yes you are gonna solve your all family problems by studying…because you have been taught from your childhood only study can solve your middle class issues. But the reality is money  going to solve your all the problems.
        Between all this family status and the financial issues your teenage have been snatched from you, you become mature before your 18’s.Lots of sacrifice at an early age…teach you how to adjust.
        You see other children of your age enjoying their life without any tension , they just get what they want. But you are watching them and thinking one day I will also get all this by my own income without knowing the fact that when you are able to get all the accessories what you want when you are in your teenage , you cannot enjoy it because the time for that has gone.
        The biggest part behind all this is you love your family and your family loves you……..they will give you what you want inspite of everything whether they have to take dept or anyhow they will surely complete your wish and you also know this. Result is  you never put your wishes infornt of them…because you cannot see them struggling just because of your stupid wish.And you stay shh…..:(
        Your whole chill time period of your life when you want to explore the world is gone. You just try try try  to make your parents proud because you know between all these insomanic nights of your parents one step of yours toward success(your exam result can say) give them a baby sleep for atleast one day.
        Its really hard to be a middle class child………..
